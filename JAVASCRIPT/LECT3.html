CHANGING OR MANUPULATING CSS OF ELEMEMNTS ;

WE WILL CHANGE THE STYLE OF PAGE CONTENT      : 

few things which we can remember in changing css of a object 
eg : - suppose if we select a element 
let content = $0;
and then we can do like this conetnt.style.color = 'red';
this will change thew color of the seletcted code in the file . 

issue is this ata a time we can only manupilate one css property ;
