    <!-- document object model is called DOM -->
    <!-- window  obejct - is global obejct -->
    <h1>hello world </h1>
    <!-- BOM - specificaslly called browser object model it allows js to talk brower other than matter than content on page  -->
    DOM 
    <!-- DOM - IS TREE LIKE SRTRUTURE . -->
    # we learn first to fetch a pericular elemrnt fetching is most important thing firstlyt for manupulation of an elememnt - this is getelemntbyid(---id---)
    we take care of 2 things here ---id---
    1st - it is callled always above documemnt object model
    2nd - it always show a single elemnts cos id is single therefore then it will give only single . 
    #for this can use class for fetching ion a single fetching method name is getelemtsbyclassname(----class----)
     with this can fetch multiple class
     # or we can also fetch by document.getelemntsbytagname(----tag----) by this methods we fetch multiple object 
    things to keep in mind 
    1st- both metjod used document object only not iside things.
    2nd- both returns a multiple itms . 
    3rd - they return a list like thing which is not a array but we can use it as an array . 

    so finallly we learet three things here 
    acessing elemts 
    1st - documnet.getelemtsbyid( )
    2nd - documnet.getelemtsbyclassname( )
    3rd - document.geteletmntsbytagname( )

    and we can equate any thing by selecting and give name to it 
    eg.n suppose ifn we give seletc something in a website and then in console we do $0 we will can fetch that elememnt and give that a namer of varrible.
    like ----- let para = $0.



    there are further more ways of se;ecting the items like 
    queryselector(#header) this there is header we use # mans its a id . 
    queryselector(.class) this select class name ki class ko select kar lega
    queryselector(tagname) 
    same we caqn select and give varrible name inb console here also

    ye toh single obejct select karega but ek chij ghai queryselectorall(.hidden) this will return all elemts whose class is hidden 


    now we have multiple ways of feteching a elements
    
    

    now see lec 2 that will tell how it gets manipulated .
